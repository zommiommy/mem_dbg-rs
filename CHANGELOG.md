# Change Log

## [0.2.5] 2024-02-06

### New

* `COLOR` flag for colorized output.

* We now print to standard error.

## [0.2.4] - 2024-08-09

### Fixed

* The size of slices was off by 8 bytes.

## [0.2.3] - 2024-08-09

### Fixed

* Mutable and non-mutable slices were returning different sizes within
  structures. At the top level, this is however unavoidable due to
  different autodeferentiation policies in the compiler, and this behavior
  has been documented. The same problem was affecting `MemDbg`.

## [0.2.2] - 2024-06-03

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug where the compiler was issuing the error `usize cannot be
  dereferenced`. Invoking `id_sizes.iter()` in the generated code was
  returning sometimes `&(usize, usize)` and sometimes `(usize, usize)`.
  Using `into_iter` gives us a consistent behavior.

## [0.2.1] - 2024-05-28

### New

* Support for network and time structures.

## [0.2.0] - 2024-04-10

### New

* Support for displaying padding in structures and tuples using the new
  stable macro `offset_of`, with an optional feature `offset_of_enum` for
  enums (the latter requires nightly).

* `MemDbgFlags::RUST_LAYOUT` flag displays structure in compiler layout;
  needs feature `offset_of_enum` for enums (the latter requires nightly).

* Support for other crates such as `maligned` and `rand`.

### Fixed

* Fixed cfgs for mmap-rs because it could not be enabled.

* Fixed size for tuples (it was not considering padding).

## [0.1.8] - 2024-04-07

### Improved

* Fixed cfgs for mmap-rs because it could not be enabled.

## [0.1.7] - 2024-04-07

### Improved

* Added missing CopyTypes for maligned types.

## [0.1.6] - 2024-04-07

### Improved

* Many new implementations for standard types such as RefCell.

## [0.1.4] - 2024-03-18

### Changed

* Removed `.unwrap()` from the examples.
